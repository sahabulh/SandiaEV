# sandia-iso15118
## Introduction
This project is a research collaboration between UNM, SNL and few other organizations. The goals of the project are to:
- virtualize the EV charging PKI environment using phenix-minimega
- answer some research questions:
  1. What’s the scalability of certificate generation/distribution?
  2. What’s the anticipated network load?
  3. Are there issues with key generation, distribution, and registration?
  4. How will revocation mechanisms scale?
  5. Will failback operating modes work when, e.g., the Root-CA is un-reachable?
  6. Are there interoperability issues with mixed ISO 15118-2, ISO 15118-20, SAE PKI Vehicles and EVSE?

## Useful repositories
