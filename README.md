# sandia-iso15118
This project is a research collaboration between UNM, SNL and few other organizations. Goal of the project is to:
- virtualize the EV charging PKI environment using phenix-minimega
- answer some research questions:
1. What’s the scalability of certificate generation/distribution?
2. What’s the anticipated network load?
3. Are there issues with key generation, distribution, and registration?
4. How will revocation mechanisms scale?
5. Will failback operating modes work when, e.g., the Root-CA is un-reachable?
6. Are there interoperability issues with mixed ISO 15118-2, ISO 15118-20, SAE PKI Vehicles and EVSE?
